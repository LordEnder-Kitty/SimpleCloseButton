# Simple Close Button

A Minecraft fabric mod made to add an X button to most vanilla inventory screens.

If modmenu is installed you will have access to the configuration screen which was made with the help of [Yet Another Config Lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) to allow users to toggle the entire mod, the tooltip displayed whilst hovering over the button, the button on each indevidual screen (inventories that share screens use the same settings though because I don't know how to separate them), and you can change the position of the button on any screen for any reason you might need to.

This mod has been playtested by myself and I haven't found any bugs or issues. If you find an issue, feel free to create an issue on this github page.

If you use a resource pack and the button's default textures to not fit with it you may feel free to make and distribute a resource pack that changes the textures. The default texture are stored under /assets/close-btn/textures/gui/sprites/widget/ and they are named "close_button.png" and "close_button_highlighted.png".
